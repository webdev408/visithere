        <h1 class="display-4">Happiness: Common Parlance</h1>
        <p>In everyday language, happiness generally refers to being successful in one's profession, having a happy family life and enjoying a great health.
          Happiness is used in the context of mental or emotional states,
          including positive or pleasant emotions ranging from contentment to
          intense joy. It is also used in the context of life satisfaction,
          subjective well-being,eudaimonia,flourishing and well-being. Since
          the 1960s, happiness research has been conducted in a wide variety
          of scientific disciplines, including gerontology, social psychology,
          clinical and medical research and happiness economics. One of the indicators of unhappiness is being unhealthy mostly through obesity and sickness of not enjoying active life. In the world happiness index, the largest economies are not necessarily ranked higher than many other smaller and medium & small economies. This fact is presented in the table below:

          <p class="lead text-center">
            The World Health Organization’s definition of health clearly
            underscores the importance of well-being: “Health is a state of
            complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the
            absence of disease or infirmity.” Well-being is a broad construct
            that encompasses multiple dimensions, which can essentially be
            divided into two large domains: objective and subjective
            well-being. As a result, various scales and indices have been
            developed to measure both domains. Some of the indicators of well
            being are finding meaning in life, experiencing a sense of
            personal growth, being autonomous in one's own decisions and
            behaviors, hedonic well-being and being optimist.

            A sustained happiness comes with being engaged in some projects
            such as learning skills to share with the community and be able to
            teach others. Once you pick a skill that you like keep working at
            it until you feel you are confident to share with the world. Some
            of the skills with greatest impact to humanity are in tech sector.
            If you have a passion for fashion, dive into the world of web
            design. It gives plenty satisfaction once you have developed and
            designed a number of websites for the community and the town you
            live in.

            "Exercise is the magic pill," says Michael R. Bracko, EdD, FACSM,
            chairman of the American College of Sports Medicine's Consumer
            Information Committee. "Exercise can literally cure diseases like
            some forms of heart disease. Exercise has been implicated in
            helping people prevent or recover from some forms of cancer.
            Exercise helps people with arthritis. Exercise helps people
            prevent and reverse depression."And there's no arguing that
            exercise can help most people lose weight, as well as look more
            toned and trim."Any little increment of physical activity is going
            to be a great boost to weight loss and feeling better," says Rita
            Redberg, MSc, chairwoman of the American Heart Association's
            Scientific Advisory Board for the Choose to Move program.

            What is the happiness index of world's 10 largest economies? Are
            they also top 10 in happiness index?. If we accept measurement of
            happiness is personal sense of growth, physically being active and
            optimist, surely material possession would run counter happiness,
            as they would add complexity in life. Greed, longing for more and
            dissatisfaction are elements of disdain and unhappiness.
